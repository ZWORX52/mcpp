# mcpp
minecraft++, server and client

## usage
pretty simple! just make sure you clone with --recurse-submodules and you'll be set; just run `make` and then you have the executable (`./mc`)

currently I only have the server implemented; naturally a client may be coming in the future.

requirement: [https://fmt.dev]({fmt})
